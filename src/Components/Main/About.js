            I love to explore. For the past 10 years, Iâ€™ve lived and worked in 7
            different countries in Europe, the Middle East, North America, and
            Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, I tried how to code, and since then it has become a part of
            my daily routine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although, writing code itself is not enough to be a good developer.
            So I am lucky to do what I love and achieve more every day.
